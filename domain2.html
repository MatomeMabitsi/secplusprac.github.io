  {q:"During a red team exercise, the team gains access to a domain administrator account but finds that all sensitive systems require smart card authentication. They discover that the smart card private keys are stored in the Microsoft Certificate Services database. What technique could they use?",options:["Theft of the CA database and key extraction","Pass-the-hash attacks against domain controllers","Kerberos golden ticket creation","Skeleton key attacks against domain authentication"],answer:"A",explanation:"If smart card private keys are stored in the Certificate Services database rather than hardware security modules, compromising the CA database could allow extraction and use of those keys for authentication."},
  {q:"A security team investigating a sophisticated attack discovers the attacker used return-to-libc attacks combined with memory spraying to bypass ASLR. The attack fills memory with useful addresses. What additional protection would prevent this?",options:["Fine-grained ASLR and Control Flow Integrity","Stack canaries and buffer overflow protection","Enhanced memory encryption technologies","Stronger compiler security flags"],answer:"A",explanation:"Fine-grained ASLR randomizes memory at a more granular level, while Control Flow Integrity validates execution paths, collectively making return-to-libc attacks with memory spraying much more difficult to execute successfully."},
  {q:"An organization's cloud security team discovers that an attacker could potentially access other customers' data through a vulnerability in the cloud provider's hypervisor. The vulnerability allows breaking VM isolation. What is this type of attack called?",options:["VM escape","Cross-tenant data access","Hypervisor denial of service","Container breakout"],answer:"A",explanation:"VM escape attacks break the isolation between virtual machines and the hypervisor, potentially allowing access to other VMs or the host system in multi-tenant environments."},
  {q:"During a forensic investigation of a compromised web application, analysts discover that the attacker used server-side template injection to achieve remote code execution. The application uses a templating engine that allows expression language evaluation. What mitigation would have prevented this?",options:["Implementing template sandboxing and expression filtering","Using prepared statements for database queries","Implementing input validation for special characters","Enforcing strict output encoding"],answer:"A",explanation:"Server-side template injection prevention requires sandboxing template execution environments and filtering or disabling dangerous expression language features that could lead to code execution."},
  {q:"A security team detects an attack where threat actors are using process doppelgänging combined with transactionnal NTFS to evade detection. The technique involves modifying files within a transaction that is then rolled back. What detection method would be most effective?",options:["Monitoring for transaction creation and process creation correlation","Analyzing file system for newly created executable files","Checking Windows event logs for service installation","Reviewing process memory for known malware signatures"],answer:"A",explanation:"Process doppelgänging detection requires correlating transactional NTFS activity with process creation events, as the technique uses transactions to hide file modifications used for code execution."},
  {q:"An organization implements a new IoT security framework that uses physical unclonable functions for device authentication. During testing, they discover potential modeling attacks that could predict PUF responses. What additional protection is needed?",options:["Implementing challenge-response protocols with noise addition","Increasing the complexity of PUF circuit designs","Adding hardware security modules to each device","Implementing stronger network encryption"],answer:"A",explanation:"PUF modeling attack prevention requires challenge-response protocols that incorporate noise or additional entropy to make response prediction computationally infeasible."},
  {q:"During a security assessment of a machine learning system, the team discovers that an attacker could potentially poison the training data to introduce backdoors. The attack carefully crafts training samples to create specific vulnerabilities. What mitigation would be most effective?",options:["Implementing robust data validation and model monitoring","Increasing the size of training datasets","Using multiple machine learning algorithms","Implementing stronger access control for data sources"],answer:"A",explanation:"Training data poisoning prevention requires rigorous data validation, provenance tracking, and continuous model monitoring to detect anomalies that indicate manipulated training data affecting model behavior."}
